# Project

## Home Page

- When you click on the "Browse Recipes" button, the scroll is moved down and there is colorful shading on our "card" items
- As the mouse comes over the images in the items, the size of the image increases slightly.
- When you click on the images, it opens in a "modal", and you can even see the images of other items (lightbox).

## Recipes Page

- We can categorize our recipes with the two category and all items buttons at the top (filterizr).
- By clicking "View Recipe", we can examine the details of the recipe in a modal (dialog).

## Contact-Us Page

- We are doing validation using HTML5 data validation tags
- In the country input field, we are using smart suggestions while entering input thanks to the autocomplete field (auto-complate).
